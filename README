# Keep Drives Alive
A little Python program to keep your external drives awake instead of falling to sleep. Wake up lazy bones!

To run the program you'll need Python installed. If you don't have it, download from http://www.python.org.

When ready add your drive letters to the "drives" array. By default there are two drives. Add a third like so:
drives = ['D', 'E', 'F']

Or just a single drive like so:
drives = ['D']

When you're ready to go, double click on the file and a console window will pop up to run the program. When you're done, close the window.

## Please Note
This program has not been tested on a Mac. If you try it and have issues, let me know and I'll find adjust to make Mac friendly.
